These are the certifications I obtained over the years.
# Accessibility
## [NVDA Certification](https://certification.nvaccess.org/)
This was an important milestone for me. I learned how to use NVDA and obtained the certification to demonstrate my knowledge.

NVDA is one of the most popular screen readers used by users around the world. It has helped many blind people become independent in using a computer.
