These are C/C++ projects I have done over the years for fun and to hone in on my skills.
# [Experimental-Assets-Archiver](https://github.com/EdgarLozano185519/Experimental-Assets-Archiver)
An assets archiver program designed to pack files (assets) used in, most likely, games. This program would go through a file listing and pack everything into a single file that could be imported into a project.
# [Client-Server](https://github.com/EdgarLozano185519/Client-and-Server-Application-Sample)
A client-server program designed to learn about low-level sockets in C.
# [Audio Connect 4](https://github.com/EdgarLozano185519/Audio-Connect-4)
An audio-only version of Connect 4 written in C++ using SDL library.
